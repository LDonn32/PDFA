# Project overview



1. I will begin be examining the key wind variables available datasets:

Mean wind speed

Maximum wind speed

Maximum gust speed

Wind direction

These form the foundation for all my subsequent analysis in the notebook.

2. I will analyse the distribution of the following wind speed variables across the airports to understand how wind behaviour differs by location:

Mean wind speed

Maximum wind speed

Maximum gust speed

Using Boxplots, Violin Plots, Histograms with KDE plots, I compare the shape, spread, and intensity of wind conditions across the four airports.

3. Using windrose plots, I will analyse how wind direction relates to mean wind speed at each airport.
This reveals dominant wind directions, directional variability, and how wind strength changes with direction.

4. I will compute and visualise 7‑day and 30‑day rolling averages for:

Mean wind speed

Maximum wind speed

Maximum gust speed

This helps identify short‑term fluctuations, long‑term trends, and seasonal cycles in wind behaviour.

5. I then will examine:

- Average monthly mean wind speed using line graphs

- Seasonal maximum gust speeds for each airport

These views highlight how wind conditions shift throughout the year and which seasons experience the strongest gusts.

6.  To understand extreme wind events, I define a storm day as any day with gusts ≥ 48 knots. I then look at 7‑day rolling storm clusters and flag clusters for periods with ≥ 3 storm days in a week

This allows me to compare storminess across airports and identify which locations experience the most frequent or intense storm clusters.

7.  Finally, I will aggregate storm cluster activity by year and extract the top 5 stormiest years for each airport.
This highlights:

- Long‑term storm trends

- Years with exceptional storm activity

- Differences in storm exposure across regions
