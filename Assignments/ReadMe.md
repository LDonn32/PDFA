This folder contains the assignments laid out in the module Programming for Data Analytics at ATU.


## Assignment 2: Northern bank holdays
Write a program called assignment02-bankholdiays.py

The program should print out the dates of the bank holidays that happen in northern Ireland.

Last few marks (ie this is more tricky)

Modify the program to print the bank holidays that are unique to northern Ireland (i.e. do not happen elsewhere in the UK) you can choose if you want to use the name or the date of the holiday to decide if it is unique.

## Assignment 3: Domains
Create a notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb

The note book should have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download

This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

Marks will be given for:

Just creating the pie chart Making it look nice As always your code should be well laid out.

If you are having difficulties, know I will be doing more on Pie charts later in this module.

## Assignment 5:
This assignment is broken into 3 parts

Upload the notebook assignment05-population.ipynb to you assignments repository.

Part 1 70%
Write a jupyter notebook that analyses the differences between the sexes by age in Ireland.

ie You can take the notebook I used in the lectures and substitute the sexes for the regions.

Part 2 20%
In the same notebook, make a variable that stores an age (say 35).

Write that code that would group the people within 5 years of that age together, into one age group
