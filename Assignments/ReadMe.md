This folder contains the assignments laid out in the module Programming for Data Analytics at ATU.


This ReadMe file for the 2025 Programming and Scripting Module for the H. Dip in Science in Data Analytics, ATU will do the following:

* Give a description for each of the assigned weekly tasks.
  
* Show how to clone the repositpry
  
* State what technologies and libraries were used.

* Includes references and additional resources used.


# Technologies

## This section covers what tools were used: 


[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[GitHub](https://github.com/)

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


# Libraries/Modules used

# Installation/ how to run

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/LDonn32/PDFA.git

```




# Assignment List:


## Assignment 2: Northern bank holdays
Write a program called assignment02-bankholdiays.py

The program should print out the dates of the bank holidays that happen in northern Ireland.

Last few marks (ie this is more tricky)

Modify the program to print the bank holidays that are unique to northern Ireland (i.e. do not happen elsewhere in the UK) you can choose if you want to use the name or the date of the holiday to decide if it is unique.

## Assignment 3: Domains
Create a notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb

The note book should have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download

This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

Marks will be given for:

Just creating the pie chart Making it look nice As always your code should be well laid out.

If you are having difficulties, know I will be doing more on Pie charts later in this module.

## Assignment 5:
This assignment is broken into 3 parts

Upload the notebook assignment05-population.ipynb to you assignments repository.

Part 1 70%
Write a jupyter notebook that analyses the differences between the sexes by age in Ireland.

Weighted mean age (by sex) The difference between the sexes by age This part does not need to look at the regions.

ie You can take the notebook I used in the lectures and substitute the sexes for the regions.

Part 2 20%
In the same notebook, make a variable that stores an age (say 35).

Write that code that would group the people within 5 years of that age together, into one age group

Calculate the population difference between the sexes in that age group.

Part 3 10%
In the same notebook.

Write the code that would work out which region in Ireland has the biggest population difference between the sexes in that age group

## Assigment 6:

Assignment 6: Knock airport Weather
Create a notebook called assignment_6_Weather.ipynb

Get the data from this link.

https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv

(This is different that the data I used in the lecture)

Plot:

The temperature

The mean temperature each day

The mean temperature for each month 

60% of the marks will be given for the above

For the last 40%

Plot:

The Windspeed (there is data missing from this column) 

The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours) 

The max windspeed for each day 

The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds (yer I am being nasty here) 

You do not need to over comment your code. Marks will be given for how nice the plots are.
